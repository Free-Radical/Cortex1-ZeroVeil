# ZeroVeil Contributor License Agreement (CLA) — License Grant (No Assignment)

Version: 0.1  
Last updated: 2025-12-28  
Project: Cortex1-ZeroVeil (the “Project”)

This Contributor License Agreement (“Agreement”) is intended to clarify the intellectual property license granted with Contributions to the Project. It is for the protection of both the Contributor and the Project.

**Important:** This Agreement is a license grant. You **retain ownership** of your Contributions.

## 1. Definitions

“**You**” (or “**Contributor**”) means the individual or legal entity making a Contribution to the Project.

“**Contribution**” means any original work of authorship, including any modifications or additions to an existing work, that is intentionally submitted by You to the Project for inclusion in the Project, whether submitted via a pull request, patch, issue, code review, or any other form of submission to the Project’s repositories, mailing lists, or issue trackers.

“**Licensor**” means Saqib Ali Khan, the copyright holder of the Project.

## 2. Grant of Copyright License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute Your Contributions and such derivative works.

## 3. Grant of Patent License

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, You hereby grant to the Licensor and to recipients of software distributed by the Licensor a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Project, where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable by You that are necessarily infringed by Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Project.

If You institute patent litigation against any entity alleging that the Project or a Contribution incorporated within the Project constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this Agreement for that Project shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

## 4. Outbound Licensing / Future License Changes

You agree that the Licensor may distribute the Project (including Your Contributions) under:

1) the Project’s current license terms (currently Business Source License 1.1 as described in `LICENSE`), and  
2) any future license terms the Licensor publishes for the Project, including the Project’s stated Change License (currently Apache License 2.0 per `LICENSE`).

This section is intended to avoid the need to re-contact every Contributor if the Project’s license changes at the stated Change Date (or earlier if the Licensor chooses to shorten it as permitted by the Project license).

## 5. Representations

You represent that:

- You are legally entitled to grant the above licenses. If your employer or another entity has rights in the intellectual property you create, you represent that you have received permission to make Contributions on behalf of that entity.
- Each Contribution you submit is either (a) an original work created by You, or (b) based on prior work that is appropriately licensed and that You have the right to submit under this Agreement.
- You will include relevant third-party license notices if your Contribution includes third-party material.

## 6. No Warranty

Except for the representations in Section 5, You provide Your Contributions “AS IS”, without warranties or conditions of any kind.

## 7. How You Accept This CLA

By submitting a Contribution to the Project, You agree to the terms of this Agreement.

The Project may use an automated CLA check (e.g., a CLA bot/app) and/or require confirmation on a pull request before accepting non-trivial Contributions.
