PRIOR ART AND DEFENSIVE PUBLICATION
================================================================================

This repository constitutes a public disclosure and prior art of the
following techniques, architectures, and system designs:

1. LLM PRIVACY RELAY (MIXER ARCHITECTURE) — Core Product
   - Multi-tenant prompt aggregation for provider-side anonymity
   - User-to-prompt correlation breaking at cloud provider level
   - Shared relay identity obscuring individual request origins
   - Privacy-preserving batching across tenants
   - Analogous to Bitcoin mixing for transaction privacy

2. ZERO DATA RETENTION (ZDR) ENFORCEMENT
   - Mandatory ZDR policy verification for cloud providers
   - Provider allow-listing based on data retention policies
   - Audit trail for ZDR compliance without content logging

3. MULTI-TIER MODEL ROUTING
   - Cost-optimized tiered escalation (cheap → moderate → premium)
   - Automatic fallback on validation failures
   - VIP/critical item direct routing to highest tier
   - Graceful degradation with human review flagging

4. DEVICE-AWARE ROUTING
   - Automatic hardware capability detection
   - GPU-capable, CPU-only, and cloud-dominant modes
   - Local-first processing with intelligent cloud fallback

5. PRIVACY-CORRECT ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLE
   - PII/PHI scrubbing must occur locally, before data reaches any relay
   - Sending raw PII to third parties for scrubbing defeats privacy goals
   - Content privacy (scrubbing) is user responsibility
   - Identity privacy (mixing/relay) is ZeroVeil responsibility
   - Clear separation of trust boundaries

================================================================================

This public disclosure is intended to:
- Establish priority and prior art for the described techniques
- Prevent third-party patent claims on these innovations
- Enable future open-source contribution under stated terms

Date of initial public disclosure: December 2025
